        <h1>Welcome to best interior designs</h1>
          <b><p>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically
               pleasing environment for the people using the space. An interior designer is someone who plans, researches, coordinates,
                and manages such enhancement projects.</p>
              <p>Interior designers make interior spaces functional, safe, and beautiful for almost every type of building. Interior 
                  designers make indoor spaces functional, safe, and beautiful by determining space requirements and selecting
                   essential and decorative items, such as colors, lighting, and materials</p>
              <p>Building a safer environment for you, our vendors, and our employees is our biggest priority.
                   From our Experience Centres to our warehouses, and from our factories to your new homes, we are
                    following strict safety protocols to make it a green zone for you.At Beautiful Homes Service, we ensure your
                     house design is in the hands of our panel of experienced interior
                   designers.</p>
                   <p>Interior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning, functional design and the effective
                        use of space, as compared to interior decorating. An interior designer in fine line design can undertake 
                        projects that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building as well as projects that require 
                        an understanding of technical issues such as window and door positioning, acoustics, and lighting.[1] Although
                         an interior designer may create the layout of a space, they may not alter load-bearing walls without having 
                         their designs stamped for approval by a structural engineer. Interior designers often work directly with
                          architects, engineers and contractors.</p><br>
                          <p>Residential design is the design of the interior of private residences. As this type design is very 
                              specific for individual situations, the needs and wants of the individual are paramount in this area
                               of interior design. </p></b><br><br>
